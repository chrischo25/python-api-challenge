WeatherPy Analysis:
1. The scatter plots show that when looking at the northern hemisphere, there is a negative correlation when comparing Latitude and Max Temp. Conversely, when looking at the southern, hemisphere, the scatter plots show that there is a positive correlation when comparing Latitude and Max Temp. This shows that overall weather does get hotter as we approach the equator.
2. In comparing latitude and cloudiness in both the norhtern and southern hemispheres, the linear regression shows that there is a positive correlation in both hemispheres. In the southern hemisphere, the percentage of cloudiness appears to increase as the latitude approaches 0. In the northern hemisphere, the percentage of cloudiness increases as the latitude increases from 0. 
3. When looking at humidity vs. latitude across both northern and southern hemispheres, there does not seem to be any significant correlation between the two. In the northern hemisphere, the percentage of humidity increases marginally as latitude increases from 0. However, in the southern hemisphere, percentage of humidity increases slightly as latitude nears 0.
